# VBA-Boilerplate

This is some non-confidential boilerplate code I made when I worked at the CRA. I will update this repository occasionally.

## search.bas
- getLastRow
  - Finds the last row of a given worksheet
- getLastCol
  - Finds the last column of a given worksheet
- searchItem
  - Finds the index of the word you are looking for in the worksheet
